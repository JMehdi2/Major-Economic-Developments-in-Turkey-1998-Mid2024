# Methods: Data Processing and Visualization

## Overview
This section focuses on processing and visualizing economic data relevant to the Turkish economy from 1998 to the second quarter of 2024. By organizing economic indicators to enhance readability and ease of analysis, deriving additional indicators and change metrics, and creating visualizations, this section establishes a robust foundation for a comprehensive examination of the Turkish economy over this period.

## Objective
The objective of the data processing and visualization section is to create organized sets of economic indicators (referred to as "Data Categories") and to evaluate the evolution of these indicators by deriving change metrics and creating graphs.

## Methodology
- Organizing economic indicators into "Data Categories."
- Deriving additional economic indicators and change metrics based on established theoretical frameworks.
- Visualizing data.

## Contents
- *Report-Parts*: Documentation of the processing operations is provided in the report’s [Methods section](https://github.com/JMehdi2/Major-Economic-Developments-in-Turkey-1998-Mid2024/blob/main/Methods-Data-Processing-Visualization/Report-Parts/Methods-Section.pdf), along with supporting documents.
- *Resources-Data-Category-X*: This directory contains resources for Data Category *X* (where X is a specific data category), including initial datasets, final processed datasets, and code files for data processing and visualization.

## Getting Started
- This section is not yet complete. However, we are sharing progress in an organized manner, recognizing that individual parts of this section serve as valuable resources on their own and inviting feedback from readers.
- As of this README file update, we have published the Methods section and other supporting documents of the report, which currently cover only Data Category 1—GDP and Final Expenditure Components, along with the corresponding code and dataset resources. Additional Data Categories will be covered in future updates.
- We recommend starting by reading the [Methods section](https://github.com/JMehdi2/Major-Economic-Developments-in-Turkey-1998-Mid2024/blob/main/Methods-Data-Processing-Visualization/Report-Parts/Methods-Section.pdf). This section will guide readers through the components of the directory, as it includes references to the annexes, other accompanying documents, and the resources for each Data Category.
