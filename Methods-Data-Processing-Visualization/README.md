# Methods: Data Processing and Visualization

## Overview
This section focuses on processing and visualizing economic data relevant to the Turkish economy from 1998 to the second quarter of 2024. By organizing economic indicators to enhance readability and ease of analysis, deriving additional indicators and change metrics, and creating visualizations, this section establishes a robust foundation for a comprehensive examination of the Turkish economy over this period.

## Objective
The objective of the data processing and visualization section is to create organized sets of economic indicators (referred to as "Data Categories") and to evaluate the evolution of these indicators by deriving change metrics and creating graphs.

## Methodology
- Organizing economic indicators into "Data Categories."
- Deriving additional economic indicators and change metrics based on established theoretical frameworks.
- Visualizing data.
