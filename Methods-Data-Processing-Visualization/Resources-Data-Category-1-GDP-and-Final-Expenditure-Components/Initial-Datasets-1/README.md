# Initial Datasets: Data Category 1—GDP and Final Expenditure Components

## Overview

This directory includes datasets from TUIK (Turkish Statistical Institute) that were used to form the initial parent datasets for Data Category 1—GDP and Final Expenditure Components. The datasets are cited below and provided in compliance with TUIK's legal terms of reuse. An initial processing step was performed on the downloaded Excel files, as described in the [Methods section](https://github.com/JMehdi2/Major-Economic-Developments-in-Turkey-1998-Mid2024/blob/main/Methods-Data-Processing-Visualization/Report-Parts/Methods-Section.pdf) of the report, in A-III-1, "The Formation of Initial Parent Datasets."

## Initial Processing

The initial processing step is described in the [Methods section](https://github.com/JMehdi2/Major-Economic-Developments-in-Turkey-1998-Mid2024/blob/main/Methods-Data-Processing-Visualization/Report-Parts/Methods-Section.pdf) of the report, in A-III-1, "The Formation of Initial Parent Datasets." This process resulted in the creation of a sheet named "Selected" within each Excel file. Additionally, the Excel file "y_gdp_exp_cli_caladj" was created to compile the annual calendar adjusted chain-linked volume indices, which are derived by temporally aggregating the corresponding quarterly series.
